# Arista Networks YANG Repository

This repository contains the YANG models published by Arista Networks.

The `release/` directory contains the fully supported Arista
YANG models. Fully supported means that the models are fully
reviewed, commented, and tested, and will continue to be supported
by EOS releases going forward.

The `release/openconfig/` directory contains the Arista augmentations
and deviations for OpenConfig models supported by EOS.

The `experimental/` directory contains the Arista YANG models that do
not meet the criteria for being under `release/`, but which we want
to make available to customers who need them before they are
fully supported. These models are not loaded by the OpenConfig
agent in EOS by default. Instead they must be explicitly enabled
by the CLI.

Use of these YANG models published by Arista Networks is governed by
the Apache License 2.0 that can be found in the LICENSE file.
